    <h1>ü•êCroissant</h1>
    <p>A croissant is a French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent shape.
    <br/>
    It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
    <br/>
    Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity. The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened laminated dough.
    <br/>
    In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30‚Äì40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and
    patisseries were baked from frozen dough.
    <br/>
    Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European countries and served as dessert all around the
    world.</p>
